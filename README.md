## üß™ Running Tests

### Quick Start with npm Scripts

The project includes convenient npm scripts for common testing scenarios:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with browser visible
npm run test:headed

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Run tests with UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:ui

# Generate HTML test report
npm run test:report

# Run tests in specific browsers
npm run test:chromium
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:webkit

# Run specific test files
npm run test:basic      # Basic examples
npm run test:todo       # Todo app tests

# Install Playwright browsers
npm run test:install

# View test report
npm run test:show-report
```

### Direct Playwright Commands

You can also use Playwright commands directly:

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run tests in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js
npx playwright test tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.js

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run tests in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate test report
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

## üìö Test Examples

### Basic Web Testing (`tests/example.spec.js`)

The basic example demonstrates:
- **Title Verification**: Checking if a page has the expected title
- **Navigation Testing**: Clicking links and verifying page changes

```javascript
test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
```

### Todo App Testing (`tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.js`)

The comprehensive todo app tests cover:

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete todos
- **State Management**: Local storage verification
- **User Interactions**: Clicking, typing, keyboard shortcuts
- **Data Persistence**: Reload and verify data persistence
- **Routing**: Navigation between different views (All, Active, Completed)
- **Edge Cases**: Empty inputs, escape key handling, trimming whitespace

Key test scenarios:
- Adding multiple todo items
- Marking items as complete/incomplete
- Editing existing todos
- Filtering todos by status
- Clearing completed items
- Data persistence across page reloads

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The project uses `playwright.config.js` for configuration:

### Key Features:
- **Multi-browser Testing**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel for faster execution
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries on failure (2 retries in CI)
- **HTML Reporter**: Detailed test reports
- **Trace Collection**: Debug traces for failed tests

### Customization Options:

1. **Add Base URL**: Uncomment and set `baseURL` for your application
2. **Enable Web Server**: Uncomment `webServer` section to start a local server
3. **Mobile Testing**: Uncomment mobile device configurations
4. **Environment Variables**: Use dotenv for environment-specific settings

## üèÜ Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group related tests using `test.describe()`
- Use descriptive test names
- Implement setup/teardown with `beforeEach`/`afterEach`

### Locator Strategies
- Prefer semantic locators (`getByRole`, `getByText`)
- Use test IDs for stable element selection
- Avoid CSS selectors when possible

### Data Management
- Use constants for test data
- Implement helper functions for common operations
- Verify application state, not just UI changes

### Performance
- Use `page.waitForFunction()` for async operations
- Implement proper waiting strategies
- Avoid hard-coded timeouts

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Installation Failed**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --force
   ```

2. **Tests Timing Out**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify target URLs are accessible
   - Increase timeout in configuration

3. **Element Not Found**
   - Use Playwright Inspector: `npx playwright test --debug`
   - Check element selectors
   - Verify page load completion

4. **Permission Issues (macOS/Linux)**
   ```bash
   sudo npx playwright install
   ```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js --debug
```

### Generate Trace
```bash
# View trace for failed tests
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
```
